      <t>
	The MPLS source routing paradigm provides path control
	for both intra- and inter- Autonomous System (AS) traffic.
	In most MPLS deployments the ingress of a MPLS tunnel
	is an IP router. Availability of MPLS forwarding stacks for host
	operating systems is extending the MPLS perimeter
	to Hypervisors and Servers. Recent Data Center designs are using an
	IGP-less routing paradigm based on massive ECMP multipath
	using external BGP.	
	This documents outlines how Hypervisors and Servers may interact with the
	MPLS control- and data plane using extensions to the
	BGP labeled unicast protocol (BGP-LU).

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Recent Datacenter routing designs are modeled like shown in
	Figure <xref target="DC_DESIGN"/>. Rather than using an IGP
	plus internal BGP (iBGP), an IGP-less design is favoured
	for disseminating routing information. See
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-routing-large-dc"></xref>
	for rationale and detailed information why and how to do so.

	Today BGP-LU <xref target="RFC3107"/>
	is used both as an intra-AS
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls"></xref>
	and inter-AS routing protocol.
	Because of the IGP-less routing paradigm
	topology information gets lost. Particularly
	the ability to direct traffic to a specific node
	and hence the ability to do construct explicit paths
	denominated by a set of nodes for traffic-engineering
	is of interest.

	BGP-LU today may advertise a MPLS transport path between
	Autonomous Systems. 
	This document describes extensions to the BGP-LU protocol
	such that in addition to the advertised MPLS label-switched
	paths (LSP) all potential MPLS label-switched paths of
	any given node in the Data Center are expsed to ingress nodes.
      </t>

      <t>
	The protocol extensions In this document are in full compliance with the
	MPLS Architecture documented in <xref target="RFC3031"/>.

    <section title="Motivation, Rationale and Applicability">
      <t>
	The specifications for Segment Routing
	( <xref target="I-D.ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions"></xref> and
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions"></xref> )
	provide extensions for setting up hop-by-hop shortest path
	routed MPLS LSPs. The used Protocol semantics are:</t>

	<t>
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>Domain-wide Index</t>
	    <t>Local Label-Base</t>
	    <t>Local Label Range</t>
	  </list>
	</t>

	<t>advertised by any router in an IGP domain. This not only
	sets up MPLS sink-trees to each egress router in a domain, but
	also allows to steer traffic using stacks of node labels.
	The chosen protocol semantics are essentially a compression
	scheme to advertise all MPLS SPT paths in a domain.
	</t>

	<t>The ability to do explicit path routing based on stacked labels,
	constructed at the Hypervisors/Servers, without running
	conventional TE-protocols like for example RSVP-TE is a lightweight
	way to scale the Data Center Fabric.
	</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Deployment Considerations">

      <t>Depending on the Sophistication of the MPLS stack at the
      Hypervisor / Server there are various levels of considerations
      for Deployement.
      </t>

      <section title="BGP-LU as Server Control Plane">
	<t>In this case the Hypervisor / Server has a "client-only"
	BGP-LU stack in order to interface to the network. This is the
	most distributed way of building label switched paths across
	the network. As soon as there is a reachability change then
	all of the Hypervisors / Servers get notified instantly.
	There is almsot no time-lag for updating servers.
	</t>

	<t>Most of the implementation complexity of a BGP implementation
	comes from the BGP Update generation subsystem. For a client-only BGP
	implementation this is fortunately neglectible as typically
	one or two (for redundancy reasons) BGP sessions are required.
	So the BGP Update Generation complexity stays limited.
	</t>

	<t>In case a restart of the first-hop router needs to be performed
	there may be some forwarding state churn at the Hypervisor /
	Server. It would be desireable that upon control-plane restart
	the Network node uses the same label-allocations than in the
	previous incarnation. Unfortunetely none of the BGP graceful
	restart extensions allows to re-aquire previous incarnations
	label-mapping state from the network. Therefore a restarting node
	will be allocating FECs to labels in temporal incoming order.
	This degrades to pseudo-random, non-predictable label allocations.
	It is desireable that a BGP-LU implementation allocates the
	labels in a deterministic way, such that temporal
	control-plane loss does not impact forwarding between the
	Hypervisor / Server and the network.
	</t>

	<t>A BGP-LU Prefix SID speaking networking node MUST implement a MPLS
	label-allocation strategy which produces a deterministic,
	local allocated label-block for all of its Prefix SIDs.
	</t>

	<t>For example an Implementation MAY statically allocate a Label
	Base of 800000 and a block-size of 16000 labels and delegate
	that label block exclusively to BGP-LU Prefix SID allocations,
	such that the same label-base is being used across
	control-plane restarts.
	</t>

	The BGP Prefix SID is a new optional, transitive BGP path
