    <abstract>
      <t>
	The MPLS source routing paradigm provides path control
	for both intra- and inter- Autonomous System (AS) traffic.
	In most MPLS deployments the ingress of a MPLS tunnel
	is an IP router. Availability of MPLS forwarding stacks for host
	operating systems is extending the MPLS perimeter
	to Hypervisors. Recent Data Center designs are using an
	IGP-less routing paradigm based on massive ECMP multipath
	using external BGP.	
	This documents outlines how Hypervisors may interact with the
	MPLS control- and data plane using extensions to the
	BGP labeled unicast protocol (BGP-LU).

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Recent Datacenter routing designs are modeled like shown in
	Figure <xref target="DC_DESIGN"/>. Rather than using an IGP
	plus internal BGP (iBGP), an IGP-less design is favoured
	for disseminating routing information. See
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-routing-large-dc"></xref>
	for rationale and detailed information why and how to do so.

	Today BGP-LU <xref target="RFC3107"/>
	is used both as an intra-AS
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-mpls-seamless-mpls"></xref>
	and inter-AS routing protocol.
	Because of the IGP-less routing paradigm
	topology information gets lost. Particularly
	the ability to direct traffic to a specific node
	and hence the ability to do traffic-engineering
	is of interest.

	BGP-LU today may advertise a MPLS transport path between
	Autonomous Systems. 
	This document describes extensions to the BGP-LU protocol
	such that in addition to the advertised MPLS label-switched
	paths (LSP) all potential MPLS label-switched paths of
	a given node in the Data Center get visible to the ingress router.
      </t>

      <t>
	The protocol extensions In this document are in full compliance with the
	MPLS Architecture documented in <xref target="RFC3031"/>.

    <section title="Motivation, Rationale and Applicability">
      <t>
	BGP-LU is often just seen as a 'stitching' protocol for
	connecting Autonomous Systems. BGP-LU is often not viewed
	as a viable protocol for solving the Inter-domain
	traffic-engineering problem.
